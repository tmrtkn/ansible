# Using user 'pi', create new user
# Run this separately from this playbook.
# This uses remote_user: pi to create another user.
# When another user is created, then rest of the playbooks can be run.
# e.g.:
# $ ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml --vault-password-file ./vault_password raspberry_pi_create_user.yml --limit <host> 
 # - import_playbook: raspberry_pi_create_user.yml
   
# Using just created user, remove user 'pi'
 - import_playbook: raspberry_pi_remove_pi_user.yml

# For every server, do basic setup things
# Goes for rpis and other also
 - import_playbook: basic_setup.yml

# Set up DNS stuff. Pihole and unbound

# Setup docker for docker hosts

# Setup monitoring

# 'ansible_host' variable to point to the public address
# and after this vpn.yml playbook, change it back to internal address
